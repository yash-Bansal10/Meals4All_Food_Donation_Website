            <h2><span>Why</span> Donate<strong>?</strong></h2>
            <p>Today, over 828 million people worldwide face hunger, a staggering reality in a world producing enough food to feed everyone.</p>
            <p>The divide between food abundance and scarcity grows deeper as climate change, economic instability, and conflicts displace families and disrupt access to essential resources. Meanwhile, nearly a third of all food produced globally goes to waste, highlighting a heartbreaking paradox.</p>
            <p>This crisis isn't just about empty plates—it's about children unable to concentrate in school, families trapped in cycles of poverty, and communities stripped of their potential. It's a call to action for all of us. Together, through mindful efforts to reduce waste, sustainable food practices, and collective compassion, we can address this urgent challenge. Let us work toward a future where everyone has access to nutritious meals, dignity, and the chance to thrive.</p>
